# 🌾 AI Crop Disease Detection System

An AI-powered web application that detects crop diseases using Deep Learning and provides treatment recommendations to help farmers take early preventive action.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 to classify crop leaf images into different disease categories. The system is designed to assist farmers in identifying plant diseases quickly and accurately.

The model was trained on a balanced dataset derived from the PlantVillage dataset.
